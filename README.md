## Installation and Setup
1. Environment: Ensure Java JDK 11+ is installed and configured in your IDE.

2. Dependencies: Use Maven or Gradle to manage dependencies. Add Selenium WebDriver and JUnit to your project:

3. Selenium: Add to pom.xml or build.gradle.
- JUnit: Include in your project's build file.
- Build: Synchronize and build your project to download the necessary libraries.

4. Test: Verify the setup with a basic Selenium test case using JUnit.

Check Selenium and JUnit documentation for specific version dependencies.

## Usage
To execute the test suite:

1. Use your IDE's built-in JUnit test runner. This is usually accessible by navigating to the test directory in your project structure.
2. Right-click on the test suite file or the directory you wish to run.
3. Select the Run option (the exact wording may vary by IDE).
This will execute the specified tests and provide you with feedback directly in your IDE.
